=======================================
* an awesome book for learning Vimscript by [Steve Losh](https://twitter.com/stevelosh)
* you can read this book online, [here](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/)

Content
=======

```
exercises.vim in the repository contains different mappings 
given in chapters exercises, with chaper number and exercise questions
```

```
exercises.vim don't have section for all chapters because some exercises
in book ask you to read different help sections, like ':help topic' or
do some changes in your '.vimrc' file etc.
```

Why
===
> it's written in starting of book that :

```
You need to type in all the commands.

You need to do all the exercises.
```

> so I thought lets be honest and record all work

> I'm new to Vimscript world :hatched_chick: so feel free to suggest things.
